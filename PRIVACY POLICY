Privacy Policy
We identify your device for target-ads so the ad provider could tell whether a certain ad was already shown to you and to 
determine if an App Store or Google Play Store ad should be displayed.

Diervsoft reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Diervsoft
or Diervsoft partners and contractors.

Diervsoft may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of 
ad serving through Services. 

Diervsoft or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as 
information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. 

Diervsoft or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address 
(including but not limited to for purposes of determining your coarse location), Device ID, MAC, software, applications, 
hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. 

The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company
providing the ad serving technology.
You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Diervsoft may combine the information collected
with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. 
These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. 
These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology,
do not use or access Services. Although Diervsoft takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising 
companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Diervsoft does not have access to or control 
of third party technologies.
